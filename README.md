## What is AWS ?

Whether you're looking for compute power, database storage, content delivery, or other features with services operated by Amazon, 

AWS has services to help you build sophisticated applications with increased flexibility, scalability, and reliability.

## What is Lambda ?

AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume.

With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration.

## What is API Gateway ?

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale.

Using API Gateway, you can create RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. 

API Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.

## What is Serverless ?

It’s a movement that is defined by empowering developers to single-handedly build apps that handle production level traffic. 

They don’t have to actively manage scaling their infrastructure. 

They don't have to provision servers, or pay for resources that go unused. They can just focus on building.
